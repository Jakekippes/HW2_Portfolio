## The Repository
This repository is where I pushed my my finished portfolio. In this assignment I used bootstrap in order to add different elements to my webpage including a navbar and a contact me section. I also followed semantic HTML in order to add an About Me and Portfolio section with responsive images and layout.

## Motivation
My motivation for this assignment was that I can take this information and skills in order to develop a portfolio in the future for potential job searching.

## Screenshot
Here are some screenshots of the completed website

## Credit
I would like to give credit to getbootstrap.com for the different elements that made my page come together like the navbar and contact me element.
